/**
 * This is a base class and cannot be used directly in a KML file. FeaturePart is a field in
 * the Feature trait. That trait is extended by: Document, Folder, Placemark, NetworkLink, PhotoOverlay, ScreenOverlay, GroundOverlay, Tour.
 * In these classes FeaturePart is a component field.
 * Note: do not confuse FeaturePart and a Feature that encapsulate it, that is the concrete classes that extend Feature trait.
 * @see Feature
 *
 * @param name User-defined text displayed in the 3D viewer as the label for the object
 *             (for example, for a Placemark, Folder, or NetworkLink).
 * @param visibility Specifies whether the feature is drawn in the 3D viewer when it is initially loaded. In order for a feature to be
 * visible, the visibility of all its ancestors must also be set to true. Defaults to true.
 * @param open Specifies whether a Document or Folder appears closed or open when first loaded into the Places panel.
 * False=collapsed (the default), true=expanded. This element applies only to Document, Folder, and NetworkLink.
 * @see ListStyle
 * @param atomAuthor KML "2.2" supports new elements for including data about the author and related website in your KML file. This
 * information is displayed in geo search results, both in Earth browsers such as Google Earth, and in other
 * applications such as Google Maps. The ascription elements used in KML are as follows:
 * <ul>
 *  <li> atom:author element - parent element for atom:name
 *  <li> atom:name element - the name of the author
 *  <li> atom:link element - contains the href attribute
 *  <li> href attribute - URL of the web page containing the KML/KMZ file
 *  </ul>
 * These elements are defined in the Atom Syndication Format. The complete specification is found at
 * http://atompub.org.
 *
 * The &lt;atom:author&gt; element is the parent element for &lt;atom:name&gt, which specifies the author of the KML
 * feature.
 * @param atomLink Specifies the URL of the website containing this KML or KMZ file.
 * Implementation note: Be sure to include the namespace for this element in any KML file that uses it:
 * xmlns:atom="http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom" .
 * @param address A string value representing an unstructured address written as a standard street, city, state address, and/or as a
 * postal code. You can use the <address> tag to specify the location of a point instead of using latitude and
 * longitude coordinates. (However, if a <Point> is provided, it takes precedence over the <address>.) To find out
 * which locales are supported for this tag in Google Earth, go to the Google Maps Help.
 * @param addressDetails A string value representing a telephone number. This element is used by Google Maps Mobile only. The industry
 * standard for Java-enabled cellular phones is RFC2806. For more information,
 * see http://www.ietf.org/rfc /rfc2806.txt.
 * @param phoneNumber A string value representing a telephone number. This element is used by Google Maps Mobile only. The industry
 * standard for Java-enabled cellular phones is RFC2806.
 * For more information, see http://www.ietf.org/rfc /rfc2806.txt.
 * @param extendedData Allows you to add custom data to a KML file. This data can be:
 * <ul>
 * <li>(1) data that references an external XML schema,
 * <li>(2) untyped data/value pairs, or
 * <li>(3) typed data. A given KML Feature can contain a combination of these types of custom data.
 * </ul>
 * @param description User-supplied content that appears in the description balloon.
 * The supported content for the <description> element changed from Google Earth 4.3 to 5.0. See the on-line
 * documentation for extensive details.
 * @param snippet A short description of the feature. In Google Earth, this description is displayed in the Places panel under the
 * name of the feature. If a Snippet is not supplied, the first two lines of the <description> are used. In Google
 * Earth, if a Placemark contains both a description and a Snippet, the <Snippet> appears beneath the Placemark in
 * the Places panel, and the <description> appears in the Placemark's description balloon. This tag does not support
 * HTML markup. <Snippet> has a maxLines attribute, an integer that specifies the maximum
 * number of lines to display.
 * @param abstractView  Defines a viewpoint associated with any element derived from Feature.
 * @see Camera and LookAt
 * @param timePrimitive Associates this Feature with a period of time (<TimeSpan>) or a point in time (<TimeStamp>).
 * @param styleUrl URL of a <Style> or <StyleMap> defined in a Document. If the style is in the same file, use a # reference. If the
 * style is defined in an external file, use a full URL along with # referencing.
 * @param styleSelector One or more Styles and StyleMaps can be defined to customize the appearance of any element derived from Feature or
 * of the Geometry in a Placemark.
 * A style defined within a Feature is called an "inline style" and applies only to the Feature that contains it. A
 * style defined as the child of a &lt;Document&gt; is called a "shared style." A shared style must have an id
 * defined for it. This id is referenced by one or more Features within the &lt;Document&gt;. In cases where a style
 * element is defined both in a shared style and in an inline style for a Feature—that is, a Folder, GroundOverlay,
 * NetworkLink, Placemark, or ScreenOverlay—the value for the Feature's inline style takes precedence over the value
 * for the shared style.
 * @see BalloonStyle, ListStyle, StyleSelector, ColorStyle
 * @param region  Features and geometry associated with a Region are drawn only when the Region is active.
 * @param featureSimpleExtensionGroup  Simple Element Substitution.
 * This is an abstract base class and cannot be used directly in a KML file. It provides
 * the id attribute, which allows unique identification of a KML element, and the targetId
 * attribute, which is used to reference objects that have already been loaded into
 * Google Earth. The id attribute must be assigned if the <Update> mechanism is to
 * be used.
 * @param featureObjectExtensionGroup  Complex Element Substitution.
 * This is an abstract base class and cannot be used directly in a KML file. It provides
 * the id attribute, which allows unique identification of a KML element, and the targetId
 * attribute, which is used to reference objects that have already been loaded into

 * @param minRefreshPeriod Specified in seconds, <minRefreshPeriod> is the minimum allowed time between fetches of the file. This parameter allows servers to throttle fetches of a particular file and to tailor refresh rates to the expected rate of change to the data. For example, a user might set a link refresh to 5 seconds, but you could set your minimum refresh period to 3600 to limit refresh updates to once every hour.
 * @param maxSessionLength Specified in seconds, <maxSessionLength> is the maximum amount of time for which the client NetworkLink can remain connected. The default value of -1 indicates not to terminate the session explicitly.
 * @param cookie Use this element to append a string to the URL query on the next refresh of the network link. You can use this data in your script to provide more intelligent handling on the server side, including version querying and conditional file delivery.
 * @param message You can deliver a pop-up message, such as usage guidelines for your network link. The message appears when the network link is first loaded into Google Earth, or when it is changed in the network link control.

 * @param linkDescription You can control the description of the network link from the server, so that changes made to the description on the client side are overridden by the server.
 * @param linkSnippet You can control the snippet for the network link from the server, so that changes made to the snippet on the client side are overridden by the server. <linkSnippet> has a maxLines attribute, an integer that specifies the maximum number of lines to display.
 * @param expires You can specify a date/time at which the link should be refreshed. This specification takes effect only if the <refreshMode> in <Link> has a value of onExpire. See <refreshMode>
 * @param update with <Update>, you can specify any number of Change, Create, and Delete tags for a .kml file or .kmz archive that has previously been loaded with a network link. See <Update>.

 * <li>Image files used in any Overlay (the <Icon> element specifies the image in an Overlay; <Icon> has the same fields as <Link>)
 * <li>Model files used in the <Model> element
 * <li>The file is conditionally loaded and refreshed, depending on the refresh parameters supplied here. Two different sets of refresh parameters can be specified: one set is based on time (<refreshMode> and <refreshInterval>) and one is based on the current "camera" view (<viewRefreshMode> and <viewRefreshTime>). In addition, Link specifies whether to scale the bounding box parameters that are sent to the server (<viewBoundScale> and provides a set of optional viewing parameters that can be sent to the server (<viewFormat>) as well as a set of optional parameters containing version and language information.
 * </ul>
 * When a file is fetched, the URL that is sent to the server is composed of three pieces of information:
 * <ul>
 * <li>the href (Hypertext Reference) that specifies the file to load.
 * <li>an arbitrary format string that is created from (a) parameters that you specify in the <viewFormat> element or (b) bounding box parameters (this is the default and is used if no <viewFormat> element is included in the file).
 * <li>a second format string that is specified in the <httpQuery> element.
 * <li>If the file specified in <href> is a local file, the <viewFormat> and <httpQuery> elements are not used.
 * </ul>
 * The <Link> element replaces the <Url> element of <NetworkLink> contained in earlier KML releases and adds functionality for the <Region> element (introduced in KML 2.1). In Google Earth releases 3.0 and earlier, the <Link> element is ignored.
 *
 * @param href A URL (either an HTTP address or a local file specification). When the parent of <Link> is a NetworkLink, <href> is a KML file. When the parent of <Link> is a Model, <href> is a COLLADA file. When the parent of <Icon> (same fields as <Link>) is an Overlay, <href> is an image. Relative URLs can be used in this tag and are evaluated relative to the enclosing KML file. See KMZ Files for details on constructing relative references in KML and KMZ files.
 * @param refreshMode Specifies a time-based refresh mode, which can be one of the following:
onChange - refresh when the file is loaded and whenever the Link parameters change (the default).
onInterval - refresh every n seconds (specified in <refreshInterval>).
onExpire - refresh the file when the expiration time is reached. If a fetched file has a NetworkLinkControl, the <expires> time takes precedence over expiration times specified in HTTP headers. If no <expires> time is specified, the HTTP max-age header is used (if present). If max-age is not present, the Expires HTTP header is used (if present). (See Section RFC261b of the Hypertext Transfer Protocol - HTTP 1.1 for details on HTTP header fields.)
 * @param refreshInterval Indicates to refresh the file every n seconds.
 * @param viewRefreshMode Specifies how the link is refreshed when the "camera" changes.
Can be one of the following:
never (default) - Ignore changes in the view. Also ignore <viewFormat> parameters, if any.
onStop - Refresh the file n seconds after movement stops, where n is specified in <viewRefreshTime>.
onRequest - Refresh the file only when the user explicitly requests it. (For example, in Google Earth, the user right-clicks and selects Refresh in the Context menu.)
onRegion - Refresh the file when the Region becomes active. See <Region>.
 * @param viewRefreshTime After camera movement stops, specifies the number of seconds to wait before refreshing the view. (See <viewRefreshMode> and onStop above.)
 * @param viewBoundScale Scales the BBOX parameters before sending them to the server. A value less than 1 specifies to use less than the full view (screen). A value greater than 1 specifies to fetch an area that extends beyond the edges of the current view.
 * @param viewFormat Specifies the format of the query string that is appended to the Link's <href> before the file is fetched.(If the <href> specifies a local file, this element is ignored.)
If you specify a <viewRefreshMode> of onStop and do not include the <viewFormat> tag in the file, the following information is automatically appended to the query string:
BBOX=[bboxWest],[bboxSouth],[bboxEast],[bboxNorth]

This information matches the Web Map Service (WMS) bounding box specification.
If you specify an empty <viewFormat> tag, no information is appended to the query string.
You can also specify a custom set of viewing parameters to add to the query string. If you supply a format string, it is used instead of the BBOX information. If you also want the BBOX information, you need to add those parameters along with the custom parameters.
You can use any of the following parameters in your format string (and Google Earth will substitute the appropriate current value at the time it creates the query string):
[lookatLon], [lookatLat] - longitude and latitude of the point that <LookAt> is viewing
[lookatRange], [lookatTilt], [lookatHeading] - values used by the <LookAt> element (see descriptions of <range>, <tilt>, and <heading> in <LookAt>)
[lookatTerrainLon], [lookatTerrainLat], [lookatTerrainAlt] - point on the terrain in degrees/meters that <LookAt> is viewing
[cameraLon], [cameraLat], [cameraAlt] - degrees/meters of the eyepoint for the camera
[horizFov], [vertFov] - horizontal, vertical field of view for the camera
[horizPixels], [vertPixels] - size in pixels of the 3D viewer
[terrainEnabled] - indicates whether the 3D viewer is showing terrain
 * @param httpQuery Appends information to the query string, based on the parameters specified. (Google Earth substitutes the appropriate current value at the time it creates the query string.) The following parameters are supported:
[clientVersion]
[kmlVersion]
[clientName]
[language]

/**
 * specifies the location of any of the following:
 * <ul>
 * <li>KML files fetched by network links
 * <li>Image files used in any Overlay (the <Icon> element specifies the image in an Overlay; <Icon> has the same fields as <Link>)
 * <li>Model files used in the <Model> element
 * <li>The file is conditionally loaded and refreshed, depending on the refresh parameters supplied here. Two different sets of refresh parameters can be specified: one set is based on time (<refreshMode> and <refreshInterval>) and one is based on the current "camera" view (<viewRefreshMode> and <viewRefreshTime>). In addition, Link specifies whether to scale the bounding box parameters that are sent to the server (<viewBoundScale> and provides a set of optional viewing parameters that can be sent to the server (<viewFormat>) as well as a set of optional parameters containing version and language information.
 * </ul>
 * When a file is fetched, the URL that is sent to the server is composed of three pieces of information:
 * <ul>
 * <li>the href (Hypertext Reference) that specifies the file to load.
 * <li>an arbitrary format string that is created from (a) parameters that you specify in the <viewFormat> element or (b) bounding box parameters (this is the default and is used if no <viewFormat> element is included in the file).
 * <li>a second format string that is specified in the <httpQuery> element.
 * <li>If the file specified in <href> is a local file, the <viewFormat> and <httpQuery> elements are not used.
 * </ul>
 * The <Link> element replaces the <Url> element of <NetworkLink> contained in earlier KML releases and adds functionality for the <Region> element (introduced in KML 2.1). In Google Earth releases 3.0 and earlier, the <Link> element is ignored.
 *
 * @param href A URL (either an HTTP address or a local file specification). When the parent of <Link> is a NetworkLink, <href> is a KML file. When the parent of <Link> is a Model, <href> is a COLLADA file. When the parent of <Icon> (same fields as <Link>) is an Overlay, <href> is an image. Relative URLs can be used in this tag and are evaluated relative to the enclosing KML file. See KMZ Files for details on constructing relative references in KML and KMZ files.
 * @param refreshMode Specifies a time-based refresh mode, which can be one of the following:
onChange - refresh when the file is loaded and whenever the Link parameters change (the default).
onInterval - refresh every n seconds (specified in <refreshInterval>).
onExpire - refresh the file when the expiration time is reached. If a fetched file has a NetworkLinkControl, the <expires> time takes precedence over expiration times specified in HTTP headers. If no <expires> time is specified, the HTTP max-age header is used (if present). If max-age is not present, the Expires HTTP header is used (if present). (See Section RFC261b of the Hypertext Transfer Protocol - HTTP 1.1 for details on HTTP header fields.)
 * @param refreshInterval Indicates to refresh the file every n seconds.
 * @param viewRefreshMode Specifies how the link is refreshed when the "camera" changes.
Can be one of the following:
never (default) - Ignore changes in the view. Also ignore <viewFormat> parameters, if any.
onStop - Refresh the file n seconds after movement stops, where n is specified in <viewRefreshTime>.
onRequest - Refresh the file only when the user explicitly requests it. (For example, in Google Earth, the user right-clicks and selects Refresh in the Context menu.)
onRegion - Refresh the file when the Region becomes active. See <Region>.
 * @param viewRefreshTime After camera movement stops, specifies the number of seconds to wait before refreshing the view. (See <viewRefreshMode> and onStop above.)
 * @param viewBoundScale Scales the BBOX parameters before sending them to the server. A value less than 1 specifies to use less than the full view (screen). A value greater than 1 specifies to fetch an area that extends beyond the edges of the current view.
 * @param viewFormat Specifies the format of the query string that is appended to the Link's <href> before the file is fetched.(If the <href> specifies a local file, this element is ignored.)
If you specify a <viewRefreshMode> of onStop and do not include the <viewFormat> tag in the file, the following information is automatically appended to the query string:
BBOX=[bboxWest],[bboxSouth],[bboxEast],[bboxNorth]

This information matches the Web Map Service (WMS) bounding box specification.
If you specify an empty <viewFormat> tag, no information is appended to the query string.
You can also specify a custom set of viewing parameters to add to the query string. If you supply a format string, it is used instead of the BBOX information. If you also want the BBOX information, you need to add those parameters along with the custom parameters.
You can use any of the following parameters in your format string (and Google Earth will substitute the appropriate current value at the time it creates the query string):
[lookatLon], [lookatLat] - longitude and latitude of the point that <LookAt> is viewing
[lookatRange], [lookatTilt], [lookatHeading] - values used by the <LookAt> element (see descriptions of <range>, <tilt>, and <heading> in <LookAt>)
[lookatTerrainLon], [lookatTerrainLat], [lookatTerrainAlt] - point on the terrain in degrees/meters that <LookAt> is viewing
[cameraLon], [cameraLat], [cameraAlt] - degrees/meters of the eyepoint for the camera
[horizFov], [vertFov] - horizontal, vertical field of view for the camera
[horizPixels], [vertPixels] - size in pixels of the 3D viewer
[terrainEnabled] - indicates whether the 3D viewer is showing terrain
 * @param httpQuery Appends information to the query string, based on the parameters specified. (Google Earth substitutes the appropriate current value at the time it creates the query string.) The following parameters are supported:
[clientVersion]
[kmlVersion]
[clientName]
[language]
 * @param id
 * @param targetId
 * @param linkSimpleExtensionGroup
 * @param linkObjectExtensionGroup
 * @param basicLinkSimpleExtensionGroup

/**
 * A Polygon is defined by an outer boundary and 0 or more inner boundaries. The boundaries, in turn, are defined by LinearRings. When a Polygon is extruded, its boundaries are connected to the ground to form additional polygons, which gives the appearance of a building or a box. Extruded Polygons use <PolyStyle> for their color, color mode, and fill.

The <coordinates> for polygons must be specified in counterclockwise order. Polygons follow the "right-hand rule," which states that if you place the fingers of your right hand in the direction in which the coordinates are specified, your thumb points in the general direction of the geometric normal for the polygon. (In 3D graphics, the geometric normal is used for lighting and points away from the front face of the polygon.) Since Google Earth fills only the front face of polygons, you will achieve the desired effect only when the coordinates are specified in the proper order. Otherwise, the polygon will be gray.

 * @param tessellate This field is not used by Polygon. To allow a Polygon to follow the terrain (that is, to enable tessellation) specify an altitude mode of clampToGround or clampToSeaFloor.

Google Earth supports the COLLADA common profile, with the following exceptions:

Google Earth supports only triangles and lines as primitive types. The maximum number of triangles allowed is 21845.
Google Earth does not support animation or skinning.

 * @param altitudeMode Specifies how the <altitude> specified in <Location> is interpreted. Possible values are as follows:
clampToGround - (default) Indicates to ignore the <altitude> specification and place the Model on the ground.
relativeToGround - Interprets the <altitude> as a value in meters above the ground.
absolute - Interprets the <altitude> as a value in meters above sea level.
 * @param location Specifies the exact coordinates of the Model's origin in latitude, longitude, and altitude. Latitude and longitude measurements are standard lat-lon projection with WGS84 datum. Altitude is distance above the earth's surface, in meters, and is interpreted according to <altitudeMode> or <gx:altitudeMode>.

 *
 *
 * @param overlayXY Specifies a point on (or outside of) the overlay image that is mapped to the screen coordinate (<screenXY>). It requires x and y values, and the units for those values.
The x and y values can be specified in three different ways: as pixels ("pixels"), as fractions of the image ("fraction"), or as inset pixels ("insetPixels"), which is an offset in pixels from the upper right corner of the image. The x and y positions can be specified in different ways—for example, x can be in pixels and y can be a fraction. The origin of the coordinate system is in the lower left corner of the image.
x - Either the number of pixels, a fractional component of the image, or a pixel inset indicating the x component of a point on the overlay image.
y - Either the number of pixels, a fractional component of the image, or a pixel inset indicating the y component of a point on the overlay image.
xunits - Units in which the x value is specified. A value of "fraction" indicates the x value is a fraction of the image. A value of "pixels" indicates the x value in pixels. A value of "insetPixels" indicates the indent from the right edge of the image.
yunits - Units in which the y value is specified. A value of "fraction" indicates the y value is a fraction of the image. A value of "pixels" indicates the y value in pixels. A value of "insetPixels" indicates the indent from the top edge of the image.
 * @param screenXY Specifies a point relative to the screen origin that the overlay image is mapped to. The x and y values can be specified in three different ways: as pixels ("pixels"), as fractions of the screen ("fraction"), or as inset pixels ("insetPixels"), which is an offset in pixels from the upper right corner of the screen. The x and y positions can be specified in different ways—for example, x can be in pixels and y can be a fraction. The origin of the coordinate system is in the lower left corner of the screen.
x - Either the number of pixels, a fractional component of the screen, or a pixel inset indicating the x component of a point on the screen.
y - Either the number of pixels, a fractional component of the screen, or a pixel inset indicating the y component of a point on the screen.
xunits - Units in which the x value is specified. A value of "fraction" indicates the x value is a fraction of the screen. A value of "pixels" indicates the x value in pixels. A value of "insetPixels" indicates the indent from the right edge of the screen.
yunits - Units in which the y value is specified. A value of fraction indicates the y value is a fraction of the screen. A value of "pixels" indicates the y value in pixels. A value of "insetPixels" indicates the indent from the top edge of the screen.
 * @param rotationXY Point relative to the screen about which the screen overlay is rotated.
 * @param size Specifies the size of the image for the screen overlay, as follows:
A value of −1 indicates to use the native dimension
A value of 0 indicates to maintain the aspect ratio
A value of n sets the value of the dimension
 * @param rotation Indicates the angle of rotation of the parent object. A value of 0 means no rotation. The value is an angle in degrees counterclockwise starting from north. Use ±180 to indicate the rotation of the parent object from 0. The center of the <rotation>, if not (.5,.5), is specified in <rotationXY>.

/**
 * The <PhotoOverlay> element allows you to geographically locate a photograph on the Earth
 * and to specify viewing parameters for this PhotoOverlay. The PhotoOverlay can be a
 * simple 2D rectangle, a partial or full cylinder, or a sphere (for spherical panoramas).
 * The overlay is placed at the specified location and oriented toward the viewpoint.
 * Because <PhotoOverlay> is derived from <Feature>, it can contain one of the two elements
 * derived from <AbstractView>—either <Camera> or <LookAt>. The Camera (or LookAt) specifies
 * a viewpoint and a viewing direction (also referred to as a view vector).
 * The PhotoOverlay is positioned in relation to the viewpoint. Specifically, the plane
 * of a 2D rectangular image is orthogonal (at right angles to) the view vector.
 * The normal of this plane—that is, its front, which is the part with the photo—is
 * oriented toward the viewpoint.
 *
 * The URL for the PhotoOverlay image is specified in the <Icon> tag, which is inherited
 * from <Overlay>. The <Icon> tag must contain an <href> element that specifies the image
 * file to use for the PhotoOverlay. In the case of a very large image, the <href> is a
 * special URL that indexes into a pyramid of images of varying resolutions (see ImagePyramid).
 *
 * For more information, see the "Topics in KML" page on PhotoOverlay.
 *
 * @param rotation Adjusts how the photo is placed inside the field of view. This element is useful if your photo has been rotated and deviates slightly from a desired horizontal view.
 * @param viewVolume Defines how much of the current scene is visible. Specifying the field of view is analogous to specifying the lens opening in a physical camera. A small field of view, like a telephoto lens, focuses on a small part of the scene. A large field of view, like a wide-angle lens, focuses on a large part of the scene.
 * @param imagePyramid For very large images, you'll need to construct an image pyramid, which is a hierarchical set of images, each of which is an increasingly lower resolution version of the original image. Each image in the pyramid is subdivided into tiles, so that only the portions in view need to be loaded. Google Earth calculates the current viewpoint and loads the tiles that are appropriate to the user's distance from the image. As the viewpoint moves closer to the PhotoOverlay, Google Earth loads higher resolution tiles. Since all the pixels in the original image can't be viewed on the screen at once, this preprocessing allows Google Earth to achieve maximum performance because it loads only the portions of the image that are in view, and only the pixel details that can be discerned by the user at the current viewpoint.
When you specify an image pyramid, you also modify the <href> in the <Icon> element to include specifications for which tiles to load.
 * @param point The <Point> element acts as a <Point> inside a <Placemark> element. It draws an icon to mark the position of the PhotoOverlay. The icon drawn is specified by the <styleUrl> and <StyleSelector> fields, just as it is for <Placemark>.
 * @param shape The PhotoOverlay is projected onto the <shape>. The <shape> can be one of the following:
rectangle (default) - for an ordinary photo

cylinder - for panoramas, which can be either partial or full cylinders

sphere - for spherical panoramas

 * the x, y scaling of the icon. The color specified in the <color> element of <IconStyle> is
 * blended with the color of the <Icon>.
 *
 * @param scale Resizes the icon.
 * @param heading Direction (that is, North, South, East, West), in degrees. Default=0 (North)
 * @param icon A custom Icon. In <IconStyle>, the only child element of <Icon> is <href>:
<href>: An HTTP address or a local file specification used to load an icon.
 * @param hotSpot Specifies the position within the Icon that is "anchored" to the <Point> specified in the Placemark. The x and y values can be specified in three different ways: as pixels ("pixels"), as fractions of the icon ("fraction"), or as inset pixels ("insetPixels"), which is an offset in pixels from the upper right corner of the icon. The x and y positions can be specified in different ways—for example, x can be in pixels and y can be a fraction. The origin of the coordinate system is in the lower left corner of the icon.
x - Either the number of pixels, a fractional component of the icon, or a pixel inset indicating the x component of a point on the icon.
y - Either the number of pixels, a fractional component of the icon, or a pixel inset indicating the y component of a point on the icon.
xunits - Units in which the x value is specified. A value of fraction indicates the x value is a fraction of the icon. A value of pixels indicates the x value in pixels. A value of insetPixels indicates the indent from the right edge of the icon.
yunits - Units in which the y value is specified. A value of fraction indicates the y value is a fraction of the icon. A value of pixels indicates the y value in pixels. A value of insetPixels indicates the indent from the top edge of the icon.
 * @param color Color and opacity (alpha) values are expressed in hexadecimal notation. The range of values for any one color is 0 to 255 (00 to ff). For alpha, 00 is fully transparent and ff is fully opaque. The order of expression is aabbggrr, where aa=alpha (00 to ff); bb=blue (00 to ff); gg=green (00 to ff); rr=red (00 to ff). For example, if you want to apply a blue color with 50 percent opacity to an overlay, you would specify the following: <color>7fff0000</color>, where alpha=0x7f, blue=0xff, green=0x00, and red=0x00.
 * @param colorMode Values for <colorMode> are normal (no effect) and random. A value of random applies a random linear scale to the base <color> as follows.
To achieve a truly random selection of colors, specify a base <color> of white (ffffffff).
If you specify a single color component (for example, a value of ff0000ff for red), random color values for that one component (red) will be selected. In this case, the values would range from 00 (black) to ff (full red).
If you specify values for two or for all three color components, a random linear scale is applied to each color component, with results ranging from black to the maximum values specified for each component.
The opacity of a color comes from the alpha component of <color> and is never randomized.
